        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <div class="tribute-paragraph">
          <p>
            Lemmy was born on 24 December 1945 in the Burslem area of
            Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. When he was three months old, his
            father, an ex-Royal Air Force chaplain and concert pianist,
            separated from his mother. His mother and grandmother moved to
            nearby Newcastle-under-Lyme, then to Madeley. When Lemmy was 10, his
            mother married former footballer George Willis, who already had two
            older children from a previous marriage, Patricia and Tony, with
            whom Lemmy did not get along.

            The family moved to a farm in the Welsh town of Benllech, Anglesey,
            with Lemmy later commenting that "funnily enough, being the only
            English kid among 700 Welsh ones didn't make for the happiest time,
            but it was interesting from an anthropological point of view". He
            attended Sir Thomas Jones' School in Amlwch, where he was nicknamed
            "Lemmy". It was later suggested by some that the name originated
            from the phrase "lemmy [lend me] a quid 'til Friday" because of his
            alleged habit of borrowing money from people to play slot machines,
            although Lemmy himself said that he did not know the origin of the
            name. He soon started to show an interest in rock and roll music,
            girls, and horses.

            At school, Lemmy noticed a pupil who had brought a guitar to school
            and had been "surrounded by chicks". His mother had a guitar, which
            he then took to school, even though he could not play, and was
            himself surrounded by girls. By the time he left school, his family
            had moved to Conwy. Whilst there, he worked at menial jobs,
            including one at the local Hotpoint electric appliance factory,
            while also playing guitar for local bands such as the Sundowners and
            spending time at a horse-riding school. Lemmy saw the Beatles
            perform at the Cavern Club when he was sixteen, and then learned to
            play along on guitar to their first album Please Please Me. He also
            admired the sarcastic attitude of the group, particularly that of
            John Lennon.

        <h3>Recording and performing career</h3>
        <h4>Motörhead</h4>
        <div class="tribute-paragraph">
          <p>
            After Hawkwind (his previous band), Lemmy formed a new band called
            "Bastard" with guitarist Larry Wallis (former member of the Pink
            Fairies, Steve Took's Shagrat and UFO) and drummer Lucas Fox. Lemmy
            and Took were friends, and Took was the stepfather to Lemmy's son
            Paul. When his manager informed him that a band by the name of
            "Bastard" would never get a slot on Top of the Pops, Lemmy changed
            the band's name to "Motörhead" – the title of the last song he had
            written for Hawkwind.

        <div class="tribute-paragraph">
          <p>
            Soon after, both Wallis and Fox were replaced with guitarist "Fast"
            Eddie Clarke and drummer Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor and with this
            line-up, the band began to achieve success. Lemmy's guttural vocals
            were unique in rock at that time, and were copied during the time
            when punk rock became popular. The band's sound appealed to Lemmy's
            original fans and, eventually, to fans of punk. Lemmy asserted that
            he generally felt more kinship with punks than with metalheads; he
            even played with the Damned for a handful of gigs when they had no
            regular bassist. The band's success peaked in 1980 and 1981 with
            several UK chart hits, including the single "Ace of Spades", which
            remained a crowd favourite throughout the band's career, and the UK
            #1 live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith. Motörhead became one of the
            most influential bands in the heavy metal genre. Their – and Lemmy's
            – final live performance was in Berlin, Germany on 11 December 2015.

        <h3>Later years, illness and death</h3>
        <div class="tribute-paragraph">
          <p>
            In December 2000, his tour was cancelled when he was hospitalised in
            Italy with flu, exhaustion and a lung infection. He was hospitalised
            with extreme dehydration and exhaustion in Germany in July 2005. As
            he grew older, he used less alcohol and drugs as he suffered from
            diabetes and hypertension. In June 2013, it was reported that he had
            an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator fitted His tour was
            cancelled in July 2013 due to a severe haematoma. He referred to his
            continuing drug use as "dogged insolence in the face of mounting
            opposition to the contrary". Towards the end of his life he had to
            use a walking stick. He had started smoking at the age of 11. In
            August 2015, he said he had cut down his smoking habit from two
            packs a day to one pack a week. He was hospitalised with a lung
            infection in September 2015, after having breathing problems when
            performing onstage.

            On 28 December 2015, four days after his 70th birthday, Lemmy died
            at his apartment in Los Angeles from prostate cancer, cardiac
            arrhythmia and congestive heart failure. Motörhead announced his
            death on their official Facebook page later that day. According to
            the band, his cancer had only been diagnosed two days prior to his
            death.
